# Day-6 Internship

## 1. Created Passwords with Varying Complexity
I made five passwords:
- Simple: `apple123`
- With uppercase: `Apple123`
- Added symbol: `Apple@123`
- More symbols and mix: `ApP!e_1@3#`
- Long and random: `aP9!kL*zM7&vB`

## 2. Used Online Password Strength Checkers
I tested the above passwords using:
- [HowSecureIsMyPassword.net](https://howsecureismypassword.net/)

## 3. Collected Scores and Feedback
Each password got a score and some feedback. More complexity and randomness gave higher scores.

## 4. Identified Best Practices
I found these practices important:
- Use 12+ characters
- Mix letters, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid common patterns and dictionary words

## 5. Learned from the Tools
I learned that:
- Simple passwords are weak and easily cracked
- Strong passwords can resist attacks for millions of years


## 7. Summarized Findings
Password strength depends on:
- Length
- Complexity
- Unpredictability
